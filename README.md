Inspiring App Demo 

To run locally, run the following in your bash of choice:

npm i
npm run dev


Here is the psuedo code I started with:

  Step one: get boilerplate react, nextjs, etc stuff up 
  Step two: get a home component set up with basic css
  Step three: get images in project
  step four: get drag & drop working for images and five drop points
  step five: implement reset button
  step six: make sure drop points only accept certain colors
  step seven: get drop points set up to work with provided images
  step eight: test test test / fix issues
  step nine: adjust css
  step ten: set up persistent local state & deploy to firebase
  step eleven: test test test / fix issues /redeploy etc

I ultimately decided against persistent state on this project, but you should be able to mostly follow along with this workflow via this project's git history.

Here are some of the resources I used when making this:
